# RefillLocal - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Executive Summary

### Project Overview
RefillLocal is a web-based directory platform that connects eco-conscious consumers with refill and zero-waste stores in their local areas. The platform aims to make sustainable shopping more accessible by providing a comprehensive, user-friendly resource for finding businesses that offer package-free products and refill options.

### Vision and Mission
**Vision**: To create a world where shopping without single-use packaging is the norm, not the exception.

**Mission**: To build the most comprehensive and user-friendly directory of refill and zero-waste stores, making sustainable shopping accessible to everyone.

### Key Objectives
- Reduce plastic waste by making package-free shopping options more discoverable
- Support local, eco-conscious businesses by increasing their visibility
- Build a community of conscious consumers who contribute to and benefit from the platform
- Launch initially in 10 environmentally progressive cities, with plans for expansion

## 2. Market Analysis

### Target Audience
- **Primary**: Environmentally conscious consumers aged 25-45 who are actively seeking ways to reduce their waste footprint
- **Secondary**: Curious consumers who are interested in sustainability but haven't yet adopted zero-waste practices
- **Tertiary**: Refill and zero-waste store owners looking to increase their visibility

### Problem Statement
Despite growing interest in sustainable living, many consumers struggle to find local businesses that offer refill options and package-free products. Existing resources are fragmented, often outdated, and lack the specific details needed to make shopping trips successful (like what containers to bring, what products are available, etc.). This creates friction in the consumer journey toward more sustainable shopping habits.

### Competitive Landscape
- Scattered local directories with limited scope
- Social media groups and community-maintained lists
- Generic business directories (Yelp, Google Maps) that lack specialized filtering for sustainability features
- Individual store websites and social media presence
