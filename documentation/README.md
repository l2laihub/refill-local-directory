- **[RefillLocal-Features-Breakdown.md](./RefillLocal-Features-Breakdown.md)** - Detailed breakdown of each feature into specific tasks and subtasks for implementation.

- **[RefillLocal-Implementation-Progress.md](./RefillLocal-Implementation-Progress.md)** - Tracks the implementation status of features, tasks, and subtasks (completed, in progress, pending).

- **[RefillLocal-Technical-Architecture.md](./RefillLocal-Technical-Architecture.md)** - Outlines the technical architecture, technology stack, data models, and key design decisions.

- **[RefillLocal-User-Stories.md](./RefillLocal-User-Stories.md)** - User stories that guide feature development from a user-centered perspective.

## Current Progress

We've completed the foundational setup of the project:

- Established the core technology stack (React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS)
- Set up essential dependencies (Supabase, React Router, React Query, etc.)
- Created the base project structure and routing
- Defined data models and database schema
- Implemented service functions for core features
- Created initial UI components for the home page

## Next Steps

The immediate priorities for the MVP development are:

1. Fix TypeScript errors related to page imports
2. Implement the city search functionality
3. Complete the waitlist email capture form
4. Enhance UI components with better styling and responsiveness

Refer to the [Implementation Progress](./RefillLocal-Implementation-Progress.md) document for the detailed next steps and task breakdown.

## Development Environment Setup

To set up the development environment:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` with your Supabase credentials
4. Run the development server with `npm run dev`

## Project Structure

The project follows a component-based architecture with the following directory structure:

```
src/
├── components/           # Reusable UI components
├── pages/                # Page components
├── lib/                  # Shared utilities and services
├── assets/               # Static assets
├── hooks/                # Custom React hooks
├── App.tsx               # Root component
└── main.tsx              # Application entry point
```

## Contributing
